## About Me

Hello! I’m Hyobin Kim, a researcher exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and biosignal. I completed my master’s degree under the supervision of [Prof. Hayoung Oh](https://sites.google.com/site/hyoh79), and I am currently conducting research advised by [Prof. Kwang-Soo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=en&user=GCDi44QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I aspire to become a researcher who bridges foundational AI modeling with practical healthcare applications, creating systems that not only interpret human states but also meaningfully assist human well-being.

My research centers around **one core question**: how can we design multimodal AI systems that understand human cognition through the fusion of biosignals, language, and contextual knowledge in real-world?

## Research Interests

- **Biomedical AI:** Human-centered artificial intelligence for clinical understanding in real-world
- **Biosignal processing:** EEG, ECG, Holter, werable sensing
- **Neuroadaptive Modeling:** Personalized and adaptive AI systems that respond to neural and behavioral dynamics
